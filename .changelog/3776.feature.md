Add support for local runtime-specific configuration

Runtimes can now accept configuration local to the compute node that is
running them. This is possible via the following configuration schema (can
only be configured via a config file):

```yaml
runtime:
  config:
    "8000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000":
      core:
        min_gas_price: 1
```

This is useful to specify runtime-specific parameters like minimum gas price
accepted by the node. Note that this configuration can only be used during
non-deterministic transactions checks as it would otherwise result in a
discrepancy.
