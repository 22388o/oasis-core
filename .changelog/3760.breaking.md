runtime: add support for transaction priority and weights

Adds support for runtime transaction priority and weights that can be set by
runtime in `CheckTx` response. Transactions are scheduled by priority (higher
first). Transaction weights are used by scheduler when creating batches to
ensure no batch passes the per round weight limit. Supported limits are:

- `count` - number of transactions - per round limit is a runtime parameter in
  registry (already existed prior to this change).
- `size_bytes` - size of transactions in bytes - per round limit is a runtime
  parameter in registry (already existed prior to this change).
- `consensus_messages` - number of emitted consensus messages - per round
  limit is a consensus parameter (already existed prior to this change).
- Custom, runtime specific weights. `internal.BatchWeightLimits` method is
  queried for custom batch weight limits on every round.
