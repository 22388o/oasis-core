go/roothash: Add commitment events

The following two kinds of events are added to the roothash service:

- `ExecutorCommittedEvent` emitted when the roothash service processes a
  commitment from an executor node.

- `MergeCommittedEvent` emitted when the roothash service processes a
  commitment from a merge node.
