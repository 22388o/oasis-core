go/consensus/api/transaction/testvectors: Extend meaning of the `Valid` field

Extend meaning of `TestVector`'s `Valid` field to also indicate that the
given test vector's transaction passes basic static validation (besides having
a valid signature and being correctly serialized).

Update `MakeTestVector()` and `MakeTestVectorWithSigner()` functions to take
the `valid` argument indicating whether the transaction is valid or not.

Update go/registry/gen_vectors, go/staking/gen_vectors and
go/governance/gen_vectors packages.

Expand go/governance/gen_vectors package to cover more (invalid) transaction
cases.
