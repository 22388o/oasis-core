github: Add ci-reproducibility workflow

The workflow spawns two build jobs that use the same build environment, except
for the path of the git checkout.
The `oasis-node` binary is built two times, once directly via Make's `go build`
invocation and the second time using the [GoReleaser](https://goreleaser.com/)
tool that is used to make the official Oasis Core releases.
The last workflow job compares both checksums of both builds and errors if they
are not the same.
