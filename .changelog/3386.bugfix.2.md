go/worker/p2p: Relay some permanent errors

Before the P2P worker would not relay any messages failing with a permanent
error. However there are cases where the client should permanently fail the
dispatch, but still relay the message to peers.

Adds `Relayable` error wrapper which can be used in handlers to notify that a
message should be relayed regardless if the error is permanent or not.
