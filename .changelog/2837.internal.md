keymanager-runtime: replace with test/simple-keymanager

Common keymanager initalization code is extracted into the keymanager-lib
crate. This enables for the actual key manager implementation to only
provide a set of key manager policy signers.
Aditionally the `keymanager-runtime` crate is removed and replaced with
a test `simple-keymanager` runtime that is used in E2E tests.
