go: Rename compute -> executor.

It was proposed that we rename the "compute" phase (of the txnscheduler, _compute_, merge workflow) to "executor."

Things that remain as "compute":
- the registry node role
- the registry runtime kind
- the staking threshold kind
- things actually referring to processing inputs to outputs
- one of the drbg contexts

So among things that are renamed are fields of the on-chain state and command line flags.
