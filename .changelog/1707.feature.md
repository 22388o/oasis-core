go/runtime/host/sgx: Add support for SIGSTRUCTs

For now this will just generate one, signed with the same key that
`runtime-loader` used to use (the Fortanix dummy key), but this will
also support using file backed signatures, once we have an idea on how
we are going to handle the process for such things.
