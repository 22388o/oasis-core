go/cmd: Improve gRPC address passing.

Introduced new `--wait` switch for oasis-node which explicitly enables waiting
for gRPC address, if it's not available yet.

Additionally, if a user forgets to prepend `unix:` for an existing unix socket
filename, it is automatically prepended and a warning is shown.
