go/oasis-node/cmd/registry/entity: Reuse signer instead of creating a new one

The `oasis-node registry entity register` CLI command previously always
created two signer factories, one for signing the entity descriptor and one
for signing the entity registration transaction.

Some signers assign exclusive access to an underlying resource (e.g., HSM) to
the given factory. In that case, all operations on the second signer factory
would fail.
