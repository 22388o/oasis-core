go/worker/executor: only remove incoming transactions on finalized round

Simplifies the executor to only remove transactions from the incoming queue
once a round is successfully finalized. Before, the proposing executor also
removed transactions when proposing a batch, which was an unneeded leftover
from before the transaction scheduler committee was merged with into executor.

Also fixes an edge case where batch was not reinserted on failed rounds.
