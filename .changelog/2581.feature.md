Version signed entity, node and runtime descriptors

This introduces a DescriptorVersion field to all entity, node and runtime
descriptors to support future updates and handling of legacy descriptors at
genesis.

All new registrations only accept the latest version while initializing from
genesis is also allowed with an older version to support a dump/restore
upgrade.
