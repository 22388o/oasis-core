go/runtime: Downtime-less runtime updates

Runtime descriptors now include information regarding supported versions,
and the epoch from which they are valid, so that updates can happen without
incurring downtime by having upgrades and the descriptor change pre-staged
well in advance of the upgrade epoch.

Note: In the initial implementation, SGX enclaves will take an unavoidable
1 epoch of downtime (the epoch when the upgrade takes effect), as allowing
attestation for provisional (ie: may never become valid) enclaves seems
moderately risky.
