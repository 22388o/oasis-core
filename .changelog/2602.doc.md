Document all Prometheus metrics produced by `oasis-node`

List of metrics including the description, metric type, metric-specific
labels, and location in the source is now available in
[docs/oasis-node/metrics.md](../docs/oasis-node/metrics.md) Markdown file. To
automate generation of this list, a new `go/extra/extract-metric` tool was
introduced. To update the list of metrics, execute `make update-docs` in the
project root. Documentation needs to be up to date for `lint` rule to succeed.
