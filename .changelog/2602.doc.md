Document all Prometheus metrics produced by `oasis-node`

List of metrics with description and file location is available in
[docs/oasis-node/metrics.md](../docs/oasis-node/metrics.md) Markdown file. To
automate generation of this list, new `go/extra/extract-metric` tool was
introduced. To update the list of metrics, execute `make update-docs` in the
project root.
