go/worker/storage: Correctly apply genesis storage state

Previously genesis storage state was only applied at consensus genesis which
did not support dynamically registered runtimes. Now genesis state is
correctly applied when the storage node initializes for the first time (e.g.,
when it sees the registered runtime).

This also removes the now unused RegisterGenesisHook method from the
consensus backend API.
