go/storage/api: Make metrics wrapper return proper types

Previously the metrics wrapper tried to support all of the different backend
interfaces, causing problems with places that perform type checks to
determine which backend type is in use.

The metrics wrapper is now changed to return a type matching the wrapped
backend type.
