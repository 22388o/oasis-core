go/consensus: Include only top K validators at genesis time

Previously, all the eligible validators were included in the
validator set at genesis time.
This has been fixed to include only the top `MaxValidators`
as specified in the scheduler consensus parameters.
Additionally, the `MaxValidatorsPerEntity` scheduler consensus
parameter is now enforced.
