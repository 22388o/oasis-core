go/worker/keymanager: retry initialization in case of failure

The keymanager worker registers only after the initialization either fails or
succeeds. In case the worker needs to replicate the first initialization will
always fail, since other nodes' access control prevents it from replicating.
In that case the initialization should be retried.
