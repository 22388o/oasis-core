go/registry: deduplicate registry sanity checks and reenable address checks

Existing deployments had invalid P2P/Committee IDs and addresses as old code
did not validate all the fields at node registration time. All ID and address 
validation checks are now enabled.

Aditionally, separate code paths were used for sanity checking of the genesis
and for actual validation at registration time, which lead to some unexpected
cases, where invalid genesis documents were passing the validation. This code 
(at least for registry application) is now unified.
