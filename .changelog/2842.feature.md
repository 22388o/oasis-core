Add new consensus-related Prometheus metrics

Four new metrics have been added:

- `oasis_worker_epoch_number` is the current epoch number as seen by the
  worker.
- `oasis_worker_node_registered` is a binary metric which denotes, if the
  node is registered.
- `oasis_consensus_proposed_blocks` is the number of proposed Tendermint
  blocks by the node.
- `oasis_consensus_signed_blocks` is the number of Tendermint blocks the node
  voted for.
