Remove staking-related roothash messages.

There is no longer a plan to support direct manipulation of the staking accounts
from the runtimes in order to isolate the runtimes from corrupting the
consensus layer.

To reduce complexity, the staking-related roothash messages were removed. The
general roothash message mechanism stayed as-is since it may be useful in the
future, but any commits with non-empty messages are rejected for now.
