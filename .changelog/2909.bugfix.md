staking: Emit events when disbursing fees and rewards

Staking events are now generated when disbursing fees and rewards.
There are two new special account IDs -- `CommonPoolAccountID` and
`FeeAccumulatorAccountID` (both defined in `go/staking/api/api.go`),
which are used only in events to signify the common pool and the fee
accumulator respectively.
These account IDs are invalid by design to prevent misusing them
anywhere else.
