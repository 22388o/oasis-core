go/consensus: Add EpochtimeConsensusParameters to the consensus backend

Adds a method for querying epochtime consensus parameters to the consensus
backend. This is temporary since we currently do not provide an epochtime
gRPC service. The `ConsensusParameters` method on the new beacon backend
can replace this method.
