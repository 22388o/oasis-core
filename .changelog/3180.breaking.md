go/beacon: Add a PVSS based beacon backend

This commit adds a PVSS-based beacon backend that hopefully is a significant
improvement over the existing beacon, in that it at least attempts to be
secure.

Note that certain nicer-to-have features/test cases not yet implemented:

- Checkpoint/restore of node beacon state needs testing.
- Slashing based on non-participation needs fine-grained protocol phase
  accounting to be secure.
- Performance with more than a handful of participants is attrocious, where
  more than a handful is currently approximately 20.
