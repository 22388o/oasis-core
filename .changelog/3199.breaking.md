go/roothash: Add support for executor triggered timeouts

Executors can now trigger a roothash timeout in case there are new
transactions waiting to be proposed, but the current transaction scheduler is
not proposing a batch. The timeout can only happen once sufficient
(configurable via a new `ProposerTimeout` runtime parameter) consensus blocks
pass since the round started. The proposer timeout causes the current round to
fail.

Note: Existing deployments will need to alter the state dump to fix existing
runtimes that do not have `ProposerTimeout` configured.
