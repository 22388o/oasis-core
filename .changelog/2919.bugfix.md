runtime: Notify runtimes of its key manager policy updates

Before runtimes were unaware of any key-manager policy updates. The runtime
only queried for the active key-manager policy at startup. This is now changed
so that the host notifies runtimes of any key-manager policy changes and
runtime updates the policies.
