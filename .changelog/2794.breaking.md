go/staking: Three-way fee split

We should give more to the previous block proposer, which is the block
that first ran the transactions that paid the fees in the
`LastBlockFees`.
Currently they only get paid as a voter.

See
[oasis-core#2794](https://github.com/oasislabs/oasis-core/pull/2794)
for a description of the new fee split.

Instructions for genesis document maintainers:

1. Rename `fee_split_vote` to `fee_split_weight_vote` and
   `fee_split_propose` to `fee_split_weight_next_propose` and
   add `fee_split_weight_propose` in `.staking.params`.
