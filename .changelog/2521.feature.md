Consensus simulation mode and fee estimator

This change allows the compute nodes to participate in networks which require gas fees for various
operations in the network. Gas is automatically estimated by simulating transactions while gas price
is currently "discovered" manually via node configuration.

The following configuration flags are added:

* `consensus.tendermint.submission.gas_price` should specify the gas price that the node will be
  using in all submitted transactions.
* `consensus.tendermint.submission.max_fee` can optionally specify the maximum gas fee that the node
  will use in submitted transactions. If the computed fee would ever go over this limit, the
  transaction will not be submitted and an error will be returned instead.
