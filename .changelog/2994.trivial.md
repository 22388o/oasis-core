runtime/src/common/sgx: Use the `pem` crate instead of `pem-iterator`

While there was nothing really all that wrong with pem-iterator,
the only reason why the pem crate wasn't being used was because
nostd used to be mandatory.  Since that is no longer a requirement
switching crates removes a overcomplicated helper function.
