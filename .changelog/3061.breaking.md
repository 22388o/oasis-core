go: Rename existing staking token to base unit

This allows introducing the concept of staking token which is defined as a
given number of base units.

Additionally, rename fields of the following `go/staking/api` types:
`TransferEvent`, `BurnEvent`, `AddEscrowEvent`, `TakeEscrowEvent`,
`ReclaimEscrowEvent`, `Transfer`, `Burn`, `Escrow`, `ReclaimEscrow`.
