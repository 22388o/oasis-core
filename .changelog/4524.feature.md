go/worker/common: Report liveness statistics in runtime status

The `control status` output will now show something like the following for
nodes which are currently in the executor committee:

```json
  ...
  "liveness": {
    "total_rounds": 78,
    "live_rounds": 77
  },
  ...
```

The information comes from the consensus layer's liveness statistics for the
current epoch. One can derive the node's liveness percentage as
`live_rounds / total_rounds`.
