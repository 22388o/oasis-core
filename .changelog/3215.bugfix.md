go/oasis-node: Omit existing entity check for non-file signers

The "registry entity init" subcommand previously always performed a check
whether an entity already exists. It did that by creating an additional
signer factory to perform this check.

Some signers assign exclusive access to an underlying resource (e.g., HSM) to
the given factory. In that case, all operations on the second signer factory
would fail. Thus we now omit the existing entity check for non-file signers.
