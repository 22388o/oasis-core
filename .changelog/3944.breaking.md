Update emitted events when disbursing rewards

Before, a single `AddEscrow` event was emitted which did not correctly
represent the actual state changes when rewards were disbursed.

Now the following events are emitted:

- `Transfer(CommonPool -> Recipient, commissionAmount)` event for the
  commissioned part of the reward
- `AddEscrow(Recipient -> Recipient, commissionAmount)` event for the
  automatically escrowed commission reward
- `AddEscrow(CommonPool -> Recipient, restAmount)` for the non-commissioned
  part of the reward (which only increases existing shares prices)
