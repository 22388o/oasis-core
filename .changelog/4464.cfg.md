go/oasis-node/cmd/node: Do not allow running oasis-node as root

Nothing in oasis-node will ever require elevated privileges.  Attempting
to run a node as the root user will now terminate the node immediately
on startup.  While there may be specific circumstances where it is safe
to run network services with the effective user ID set to 0, the
overwelming majority of cases where this is done is misconfiguration.

If the previous behavior is required, the binary must be run in
unsafe/debug mode (via the intentionally undocumented flag), and
`debug.allow_root` must also be set.
