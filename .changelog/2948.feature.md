go/consensus/genesis: Add a public key blacklist

This change adds a public key blacklist to the consensus parameters.
All signatures made by public keys in the blacklist will be rejected.

WARNING: For now the node will panic on startup if the genesis staking
ledger has entries for blacklisted public keys.  By the time this
feature is actually put to use (hopefully never), the staking ledger
address format will be changed, resolving this caveat.
