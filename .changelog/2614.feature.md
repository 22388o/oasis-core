go/registry: Handle the old and busted node descriptor envelope

The old node descriptor envelope has one signature.  The new envelope has
multiple signatures, to ensure that the node has access to the private
component of all public keys listed in the descriptor.

The correct thing to do, from a security standpoint is to use a new set
of genesis node descriptors.  Instead, this change facilitates the
transition in what is probably the worst possible way by:

 * Disabling signature verification entirely for node descriptors listed
   in the genesis document (Technically this can be avoided, but there
   are other changes to the node descriptor that require no verification
   to be done if backward compatibility is desired).

 * Providing a conversion tool that fixes up the envelopes to the new
   format.

 * Omitting descriptors that are obviously converted from state dumps.

Note: Node descriptors that are using the now deprecated option to use
the entity key for signing are not supported at all, and backward
compatibility will NOT be maintained.
