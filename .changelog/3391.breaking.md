roothash: Add support for failure indicating commitments

Failure-indicating executor commits are introduced in order to give the
compute nodes a possibility to vote for failure when they cannot execute the
given batch (e.g., due to unavailability of storage). Such commits will always
trigger a discrepancy during discrepancy detection and will vote for failing
the round in discrepancy resolution phase.
