go/genesis: Remove time sanity check

Previously the genesis document sanity check rejected genesis documents with
future timestamps which made it awkward to prepare the node in advance. Since
the only supported consensus backend (Tendermint) can handle future
timestamps by delaying the consensus process, allow such genesis documents.
