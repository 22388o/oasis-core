go/roothash: Drop support for multiple committees

Since there is currently no transaction scheduler implementation which would
support multiple committees, there is no sense in having the merge node as it
could be a source of bugs.

The merge node is also the only client for the Merge* storage operations, so
they can just be removed in order to reduce the exposed API surface.
