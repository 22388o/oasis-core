go/oasis-node: Fix signer configuration via YAML

The `--signer` argument has been renamed to `--signer.backend` to allow
signer configuration to be passed via a YAML config. Previously, this would
be impossible as `signer` would need to be both a string and a map at the
same time when set via a YAML config.
