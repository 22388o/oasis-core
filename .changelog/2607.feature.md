Implement node upgrade mechanism

The node now accepts upgrade descriptors which describe the upgrade to carry
out. It can shut down at the appropriate epoch and then execute any required
migration handlers on the node itself and on the consensus layer.  Once a
descriptor is submitted, the old node can be normally restarted and used until
the upgrade epoch is reached; the new binary can not be used at all until the
old binary has had a chance to reach the upgrade epoch. Once that is reached,
the old binary will refuse to start.
