go/worker/common/host: Emit events on (re)starts/failures.

This replaces the previous mechanism which was implemented twice, first to receive the CapabilityTEE
and second to receive the runtime version.

The new mechanism is based on events so that the caller is able to get notified when changes occur
(e.g., on restarts).
