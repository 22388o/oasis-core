go/consensus/tendermint: Request state refresh on consensus init

Previously pending upgrade descriptors were only refreshed during governance
proposal execution or after finishing a state sync. This is changed so that
the `MessageStateSyncCompleted` message is also emitted after consensus
initialization on already synced nodes so pending upgrades get installed even
in case state was synced manually (out of band).
