release: Create a stable branch when preparing a new release

Currently we create a stable release branch only once we need to backport some
changes. This PR changes the release process to create the stable branch when
creating a new release. This will ensure CI jobs hooked to stable/ branches,
such as building a release tagged CI docker image, will be run for every
release.
