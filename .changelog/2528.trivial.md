go/oasis-node: Reduce node test flakiness on certain systems

There's been intermittent failures on certain systems (read: my laptop)

This adds a helper `MustTransitionEpoch` that monitors the roothash
backend for a block in the requested epoch, that can be called after
the force advancing the epoch with the mock backend, to ensure that the
roothash's view of the world is caught up enough where required.
