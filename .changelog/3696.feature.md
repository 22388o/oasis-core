go/worker/storage: Add StorageRPC role and change access policy

Getting checkpoints and diffs is now allowed for any connecting node,
which eliminates a race condition and initialization difficulty in the
storage committee node startup.

State access is made gated but optionally public as before, depending on
command line parameters.
