go/consensus/tendermint: sync-worker additionally check block timestamps

Sync-worker relied on Tendermint fast-sync to determine if the node is still
catching up. This PR adds aditional condition that the latest block is not
older than 1 minute. This prevents cases where node would report as caught up
after stopping fast-sync, but before it has actually caught up.
