common/node: Verify AVR quote status

When verifying a TEECapabilities structure, additionally verify the
quote status against the new SGXConstraints.AllowedQuoteStatuses vector
so that nodes that have an invalid quote status can be omitted from
scheduling entirely.

Note: QuoteOK is ALWAYS allowed, as disallowing it is nonsensical.
