Make storage per-runtime.

Previously there was a single storage backend used by `oasis-node` which required that a single
database supported multiple namespaces for the case when multiple runtimes were being used in a
single node.

This change simplifies the storage database backends by removing the need for backends to implement
multi-namespace support, reducing overhead and cleanly separating per-runtime state.

Due to this changing the internal database format, this breaks previous (compute node) deployments
with no way to do an automatic migration.
