registry: Disallow entity signed node registrations

This feature is mostly useful for testing and should not be used in
production, basically ever.  Additionally when provisioning node
descriptors, `--node.is_self_signed` is now the default.

Note: Breaking if anyone happens to use said feature, but enabling said
feature is already feature-gated, so this is unlikely.
