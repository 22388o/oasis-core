go/staking: Increase reward amount denominator

This allows the genesis block writer to specify finer reward rates.

Associated genesis controls analysis:

```
RewardAmountDenominator
|- AddRewards
|  |- RewardFactorEpochElectionAny
|  '- RewardFactorEpochSigned
'- AddRewardSingleAttenuated
   '- RewardFactorBlockProposed
```

Note to the genesis block writer: scale rewards factors **up** by a
factor of **1,000**.
