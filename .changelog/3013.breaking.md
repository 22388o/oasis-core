go/staking: Rename fields in `Event` structure

Fields in the `Event` structure are renamed to drop the `Event` suffix,
breaking Go API compatibility. This has the following effect:

- `TransferEvent` field is renamed to `Transfer`.

- `BurnEvent` field is renamed to `Burn`.

- `EscrowEvent` field is renamed to `Escrow`.

The wire format of the event structure is unchanged.
