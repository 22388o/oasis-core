go/oasis-test-runner: Improve txsource E2E test

This commit adds the following general txsource scenario features:

- Support for multiple parallel workloads.
- Restart random nodes on specified interval.
- Ensure consensus liveness for the duration of the test.

It also adds an oversized txsource workload which submits oversized
transactions periodically.
