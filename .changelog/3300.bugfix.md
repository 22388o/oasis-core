go/worker/executor: Clear tx queue before returning to committee

Fixes a bug where an executor returning to committee would propose stale
transactions that it received right before exiting committee in previous
epoch, due to a race condition between adding transaction to the queue and
clearing the queue.
Clearing the incoming queue is now done before node starts being a compute
worker instead of after it stops being.
