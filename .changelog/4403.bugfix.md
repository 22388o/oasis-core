go/worker/storage: Limit number of rounds to fetch before applying them

Previously, when a node was syncing from genesis, it would try to fetch all
unapplied rounds before applying them.
This could mean trying to fetch 100k+ rounds before applying them.
In combination with failing to fetch rounds and random retrying, this could
make the syncing process unbearably slow.
