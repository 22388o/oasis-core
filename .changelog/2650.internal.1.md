Replace redundant fields with `Consensus` accessors

`Backend` in `go/consensus/api` contains among others accessors for
`Beacon`, `EpochTime`, `Registry`, `RootHash`, `Scheduler`, and
`KeyManager`. Use those instead of direct references. The following
structs were affected:

- `Node` in `go/cmd/node`,
- `Node` in `go/common/commmittee`,
- `Worker` in `go/common`,
- `clientCommon` in `go/runtime/client`,
- `Group` in `go/worker/common/committee`.
