go/worker: Make worker registration event-based.

Previously, registration was based exclusively on epoch transitions which meant that in case the
node was not yet ready to service requests when an epoch transition happened, it needed to block the
registration goroutine until it was ready.

This prevented updating the registration in reaction to some worker event that causes the node
descriptor to become invalid (e.g., due to a runtime restart invalidating the RAK).

Node registration API was changed as follows:

- Each part of the code that wishes to contribute something to the node descriptor first asks the
  registration worker to create a RoleProvider. This reserves a slot which is "not ready" by
  default.

- The registration worker is changed so that it reacts to both epoch transitions and role provider
  changes. When a change is detected, the registration worker will check if all RoleProvider slots
  indicate that the slot is "ready". In case any is not ready, registration will not proceed.

- Anyone that has a reference to a RoleProvider can signal that the slot has become either "ready"
  or "not ready".
