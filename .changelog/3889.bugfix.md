Runtime workers should wait for history reindex

If a node first syncs consensus without any runtimes configured and a runtime
is configured later, the workers should wait for historic runtime block
reindexing to complete before continuing with initialization. Otherwise
historic block queries may fail and prevent the worker from operating
normally.
