go/runtime/enclaverpc: Refactor gRPC endpoint routing

Previously each endpoint required its own gRPC service. But since all
EnclaveRPC requests already include an "endpoint" field, it is better to use
that for routing requests.

This commit adds a new enclaverpc.Endpoint interface that is used as an
endpoint descriptor. All endpoints must be registered in advance (e.g.,
during init). It also changes the key manager EnclaveRPC support to use the
new API.
