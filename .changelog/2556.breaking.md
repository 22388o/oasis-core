go/registry: Avoid storing full TLS certificates

Previously the node registry descriptor contained full TLS certificates for
talking with nodes via gRPC. This changes it so that only TLS public keys are
used when verifying peer certificates for TLS authentication.

This makes the registry descriptors smaller and also makes it easier to pass
around TLS identities (as public keys are much shorter).

Obviously, this change BREAKS the consensus protocol and all previously
signed node descriptors.

The following configuration changes are needed due to this change:

- In `oasis-node registry node` CLI, the `--node.committee_address` option
  has been renamed to `--node.tls_address` and the format has changed from
  `<certificate>@ip:port` to `<pubkey>@ip:port`.

- For configuring sentry nodes on the workers, the
  `--worker.sentry.cert_file` has been _removed_. Instead, the
  `--worker.sentry.address` now takes the same address format as specified
  above (`<pubkey>@ip:port`).

Previously signed node descriptors (v0) are considered valid at genesis time
iff the node is exclusively a validator node as indicated by the role bits.
Other nodes will need to be removed from genesis.
