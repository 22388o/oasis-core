go/consensus/tendermint/roothash: Fix latest block reindexing

Only commit the block in case it was not already committed during reindex.
This can happen when reindexing after a crash (e.g., the before_index crash
point) since the initial height at which the reindex happens does not
necessarily contain a round finalization event so reindexing up to height-1
doesn't help.

Discovered during long-term tests.
