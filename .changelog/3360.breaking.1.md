Compare protocol versions according to SemVer 2.0.0

As described in our [Versioning] document, we bumped the protocol versions to
version 1.0.0 with the release of [Oasis Core 20.10].

Hence, we also need to modify how we compare and detect backward-incompatible
changes to follow SemVer 2.0.0 rules.

From now onwards, only a change in a protocol's major version signifies
a backward-incompatible change.
