consensus: base64 encode all tendermint event values

Tendermint 0.35 requires all events to be actual strings and doesn't support
binary data anymore. It also requires no dashes in attribute keys.

Although oasis-core still uses Tendermint 0.34, events are updated now to
avoid breaking changes later.
