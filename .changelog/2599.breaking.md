registry: Ensure that node descriptors are signed by all public keys

To ensure that nodes demonstrate proof that they posess the private keys
for all public keys contained in their descriptor, node descriptors now
must be signed by the node, consensus, p2p and TLS certificate key.

Note: Node descriptors generated prior to this change are now invalid and
will be rejected.
