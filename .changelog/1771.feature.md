Add metrics for inter-node communcation

- New `module` label was added to `oasis_codec_size` metric which contains
  information of the caller. Currently `p2p` value denotes a peer-to-peer
  message among Oasis nodes and `runtime-host` a message from/to enclave.
- New `oasis_rhp_latency` summary metric for measuring Runtime Host
  communication latency was added.
- New `oasis_rhp_successes` and `oasis_rhp_failures` counter metrics for
  counting number of successful and failed Runtime Host calls respectively
  were added.
