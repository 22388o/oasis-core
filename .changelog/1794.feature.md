Refresh node descriptors mid-epoch.

Previously node descriptors were only refreshed on an epoch transition which meant that any later
updates were ignored until the next epoch. This caused stale RAKs to stay in effect when runtime
restarts happened, causing attestation verification to fail.

Enabling mid-epoch refresh makes nodes stay up to date with committee member node descriptor
updates.
