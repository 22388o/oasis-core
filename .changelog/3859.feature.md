Bump Badger database to v3

The old database will automatically be converted during the initial node
startup. For this reason the following should be taken into account when
upgrading:

- Initial startup time will be longer as a full database migration needs to
  be performed for each of the internal databases. The migration may take up
  to an hour for large databases.

- In order to ensure a backup exists in the unlikely case that anything goes
  wrong with the migration, the old databases will be kept in the same
  location but with a `.backup` suffix. *For this reason, make sure that you
  have enough free disk space to accommodate a copy of the node's data
  directory.*
