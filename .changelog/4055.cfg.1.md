runtime: Change OASIS_STRICT_AVR_VERIFY to OASIS_UNSAFE_LAX_AVR_VERFIY

Previous builds would default to lax verification.  After this change
the default verify behavior will be the strict (requires `OK` quote
status), unless `OASIS_UNSAFE_LAX_AVR_VERIFY` is set.

Note: As with previously, this option has no effect if AVR verification
is disabled entirely.
