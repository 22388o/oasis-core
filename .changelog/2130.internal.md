go/control: Add IsReady() and WaitReady() RPC methods

Beside `IsSynced()` and `WaitSynced()` which are triggered when the consensus
backend is synced, new `IsReady()` and `WaitReady()` methods have been added
to the client protocol. These are triggered when all node workers have been
initialized (including the runtimes) and the hosted processes are ready to
process requests.

In addition new `oasis-node debug control wait-ready`
command was added which blocks the client until the node is ready.
