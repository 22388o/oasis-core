go/consensus/api/transaction: Support multi-sig accounts

This adds preliminary internal support required for the new
multi-signature accounts, and changes everything to use the new
multi-signature account addresses and envelope.

Notes:

- Tooling to actually generate multi-signature accounts, and to sign
  transactions with accounts containing more than 1 public key is not
  yet implemented.

- The `registry node` subcommand option `node.entity_id` has been
  renamed to `node.entity_address`.
