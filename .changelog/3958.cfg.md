Change IAS proxy client authentication configuration

Previously the full TLS certificate needed to be passed when configuring the
IAS proxy client, but now only the public key needs to be included.

The `ias.tls` configuration option is removed and `ias.proxy_addr` is
renamed to `ias.proxy.address`. One can now configure multiple proxy
addresses and each address needs to contain the Base64-encoded public key,
for example: `<pubkey>@ias.oasis.dev`.
