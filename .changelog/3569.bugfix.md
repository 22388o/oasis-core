go/runtime/scheduling: Consumer should pull from scheduler

Previously the scheduler would push batches to the consumer (e.g. compute
node) which makes no sense as the consumer knows when it's ready to accept
new batches. This changes the model so that the consumer pulls batches from
the scheduler.
