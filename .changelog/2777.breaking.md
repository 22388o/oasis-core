go/staking: include LastBlockFees in genesis

Previosuly last block fees in the block of the genesis dump were lost. In the
case when these fees were non-zero this also caused a missmatch in total token
supply. Last block fees are now exported and during initialization of the new
chain moved to the common pool.
