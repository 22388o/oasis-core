go/worker/storage: Remove separate storage sync status store

Previously the worker maintaned a separate store that kept information about
the progress of storage sync. Since it was a separate store this could cause
problems if it got out of sync (e.g. due to partial manual copies). This
should make the process more robust as there is only one source of truth.
