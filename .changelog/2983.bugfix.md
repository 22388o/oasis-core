staking: Don't emit zero-amount staking events

If fees were set to 0, staking events related to the fee accumulator
would still get emitted with zero amounts, which is pointless.

This fix affects only events related to the internal fee accumulator
and common pool accounts, manual transfers with 0 as the amount will
still get emitted.
