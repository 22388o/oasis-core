Refactoring of roothash genesis block for runtime.

- `RuntimeGenesis.Round` field was added to the roothash block for the runtime
which can be set by `--runtime.genesis.round` flag.
- The `RuntimeGenesis.StorageReceipt` field was replaced by `StorageReceipts` list,
one for each storage node.
- Support for `base64` encoding/decoding of `Bytes` was added in rust.
