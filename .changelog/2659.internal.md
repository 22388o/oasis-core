go/storage: Refactor checkpointing interface

Previously the way storage checkpoints were implemented had several
drawbacks, namely:

- Since the checkpoint only streamed key/value pairs this prevented
  correct tree reconstruction as tree nodes also include a Round field
  which specifies the round at which a given tree node was created.

- While old checkpoints were streamed in chunks and thus could be
  resumed or streamed in parallel from multiple nodes, there was no
  support for verifying the integrity of a single chunk.

This change introduces an explicit checkpointing mechanism with a simple
file-based backend reference implementation. The same mechanism could
also be used in the future with Tendermint's app state sync proposal.
