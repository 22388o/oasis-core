go/registry: Add `ConsensusParams.MaxNodeExpiration`

Node expirations being unbound is likely a bad idea.  This adds a
consensus parameter that limits the maximum lifespan of a node
registration, to a pre-defined number of epochs (default 5).

Additionally the genesis document sanity checker is now capable of
detecting if genesis node descriptors have invalid expirations.

Note: Existing deployments will need to alter the state dump to
configure the maximun node expiration manually before a restore
will succeed.
