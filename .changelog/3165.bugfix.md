go/common/crypto/drbg: Also consider empty slices as Null values

The wrong handling of an edge case in the HMAC_DRBG implementation has been
corrected. An update with empty `additional_data` now behaves the same as an
update with nil additional data. While the spec is not 100% clear around how
this is to be treated, supplemental documentation suggests that this is the
correct way to handle it.

Oasis code never uses HMAC_DRNG with a non-nil empty `additional_data`
parameter, so nothing changes for Oasis users.
