Make oasis-node binaries made with GoReleaser via GitHub Actions reproducible
again.

Add `-buildid=` back to `ldflags` to make builds reproducible again.

As noted in [60641ce](
https://github.com/oasislabs/oasis-core/commit/60641ce41a9c2402f1b539375e1dd4e0eb45272d),
this should be no longer necessary with Go 1.13.4+, but there appears to be a
[specific issue with GoReleaser's build handling](
https://github.com/oasislabs/goreleaser/issues/1).
