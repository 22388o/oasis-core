Prevent startup when file descriptor limit is too low

Before, a warning was emitted if file descriptor limit was low (below 1024).
Since low file descriptor limit can cause problems with BadgerDB, a
high enough limit is now required on node startup (at least 50000).

Follow the [File Descriptor Limit] documentation page for details on how to
increase the limit on your system.
