go/worker/sentry: Do client authentication on sentry control grpc

The following configuration changes are needed due to this change:

- Added: `worker.sentry.control.authorized_pubkey` option to configure
allowed upstream nodes. This should be set to sentry client TLS keys of
upstream nodes.
- Renamed: `worker.sentry.control_port` option to
`worker.sentry.control.port`.
