Add ability to set a non-zero initial commission schedule

When setting the initial commission schedule for an account, the
`RateBoundLead` restriction is ignored. Therefore the initial bounds and rates
can be set for the first next epoch aligned with `RateChangeInterval`.

This effectively means that accounts without a configured commission schedule
should be considered as having bounds: `0%-100%`, as the initial schedule can
be set at any next epoch.
