storage/mkvs: Only nil value should mean deletion

Previously an empty value in the write log signalled that the given entry is a
delete operation instead of an insert one. This was incorrect as inserting an
empty byte string is allowed. The value is now wrapped in an `Option`, with
`None` (`nil` in Go) meaning delete and `Some(vec![])` (`[]byte{}` in Go)
meaning insert empty value.

This change is BREAKING as it changes write log semantics and thus it breaks
the runtime worker-host protocol.
