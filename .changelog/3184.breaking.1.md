go/worker/executor: Support multiple transaction schedulers

Transaction scheduling committee is removed and the transaction scheduler
worker is merged into the executor worker. Transaction scheduling gRPC service
is removed and runtime transaction submission is now done via libp2p's
gossipsub.

Each active executor worker now also acts as a transaction scheduler.
Each round one of the executors acts as the scheduler and is expected to
propose a batch for scheduling. Nodes switch between schedulers in round-robin
fashion.

Metric changes:

Existing transaction scheduler incoming queue size metrics was renamed:

- `oasis_worker_txnscheduler_incoming_queue_size` ->
`oasis_worker_incoming_queue_size`
