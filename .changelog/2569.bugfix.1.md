Use a newer version of the oasis-core tendermint fork

The updated fork has additional changes to tendermint to hopefully
prevent the node from crashing if the file descriptors available to the
process get exhausted due to hitting the rlimit.

While no forward progress can be made while the node is re-opening the
WAL, the node will now flush incoming connections that are in the process
of handshaking, and retry re-opening the WAL instead of crashing with
a panic.
