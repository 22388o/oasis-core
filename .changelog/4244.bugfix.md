go/runtime: Add key manager EnclaveRPC support to client runtime hosts

Previously runtimes hosted on client nodes were not able to issue EnclaveRPC
requests as the endpoint was not implemented in the handler. This unifies the
handler implementations between the client and compute nodes and makes sure
that key manager requests are possible (of course client nodes will only be
able to request public keys).
