go/oasis-node/cmd/debug: Add the `dumpdb` command

This command will attempt to extract the ABCI state from a combination
of a shutdown node's on-disk database and the genesis document currently
being used by the network, and will write the output as a JSON formatted
genesis document.

Some caveats:

- It is not guaranteed that the dumped output will be usable as an
  actual genesis document without manual intervention.

- Only the state that would be exported via a normal dump from a running
  node will be present in the dump.

- The epochtime base will be that of the original genesis document, and
  not the most recent epoch (different from a genesis dump).
