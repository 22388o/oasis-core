go/worker/storage: Handle state sync before runtime is operational

Previously there was an edge case that was not handled when the runtime was
registered in the consensus layer but not yet operational (e.g., there have
been no normal blocks yet). If a new node used state sync to quickly catch up
with the consensus layer and sync to a height after runtime's genesis, the
node would never register as it would keep waiting for storage checkpoints
(which wouldn't exist yet).
