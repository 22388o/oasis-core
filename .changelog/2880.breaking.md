go/consensus: Enable periodic state checkpoints

This adds the following consensus parameters which control how state
checkpointing is to be performed (currently not enforced):

- `state_checkpoint_interval` is the interval (in blocks) on which state
  checkpoints should be taken.

- `state_checkpoint_num_kept` is the number of past state checkpoints to
  keep.

- `state_checkpoint_chunk_size` is the chunk size that should be used when
  creating state checkpoints.
