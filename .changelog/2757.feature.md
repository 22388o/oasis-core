Introduce the *canonical* form of a Genesis file

This form is the pretty-printed JSON file with 2-space indents, where:

- Struct fields are encoded in the order in which they are defined in the
  corresponding struct definitions.
- Maps have their keys converted to strings which are then encoded in
  lexicographical order.

For more details, see the [Genesis Document] documentation.

The `oasis-node genesis init` and `oasis-node genesis dump` CLI commands are
updated to output Genesis file in this canonical form.
