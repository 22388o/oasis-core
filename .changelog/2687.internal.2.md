`oasis-node`: Add custom internal socket path flag (for E2E tests only!)

`--debug.grpc.internal.socket_name` flag was added which forces `oasis-node`
to use the given path for the internal gRPC socket. This was necessary,
because some E2E test names became very lengthy and original datadir exceeded
the maximum unix socket path length. `oasis-test-runner` now generates
shorter socket names in `/tmp/oasis-test-runnerXXXXXX` directory and provides
them to `oasis-node`. **Due to security risks never ever use this flag in
production-like environments. Internal gRPC sockets should always reside in
node datadir!**
