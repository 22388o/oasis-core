go/control: List all valid TLS public keys in identity status

This changes the `Identity` field in the reposnse of the `GetStatus` method
exposed by the node controller service to include all valid TLS public keys
for the node. This change affects nodes using automatic certificate rotation,
which at any point use 2 valid TLS public keys.
