Switch to unified runtime bundles

Instead of distributing runtime binaries separately, and having the node
operator configure the appropriate binary based on runtime ID, runtime
artifacts are now distributed under a single self-describing "fat"
bundle file.

To configure runtimes the new syntax is:

```
runtime:
  paths:
    - examplepath/runtime.orc
    - anotherExamplePath/anotherRuntime.orc
```

If the commandline is being used `runtime.paths` now only takes the path
to the runtime bundle(s).

This requires downloading new builds of the runtime binaries that are
packaged in this format.
