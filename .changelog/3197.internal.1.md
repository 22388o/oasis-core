go: Explicitly use public key pinning for certificate verification

While we only ever use public key pinning for authenticating TLS connections,
some places still used the regular TLS config with a single certificate in
the certificate pool. This causes failures on Go 1.15+ due to CommonName
checks being deprecated, even if we never used hostnames for authentication.

This changes all cases to use our explicit public key pinning credentials for
gRPC connections.
