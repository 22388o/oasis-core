go/runtime/client: Add `GetTransactions` method, deprecate `GetTxs`

A new method called `GetTransactions` has been added to replace the (now
deprecated) `GetTxs`. The new method does not require the caller to pass
the IO root as that is an internal detail. This makes it consistent with
the existing `GetEvents` API.

Users of `GetTxs` should migrate to `GetTransactions` as the former may be
removed in a future release.
