go/worker/consensusrpc: Add public consensus RPC services worker

A public consensus services worker enables any full consensus node to expose
light client services to other nodes that may need them (e.g., they are needed
to support light clients).

The worker can be enabled using `--worker.consensusrpc.enabled` and is
disabled by default. Enabling the public consensus services worker exposes
the light consensus client interface over publicly accessible gRPC.
