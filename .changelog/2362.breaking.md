Simplify tendermint sentry node setup.

Breaking configuration changes:
- `worker.sentry.address` renamed to: `worker.registration.sentry.address`
- `worker.sentry.cert_file` renamed to: `worker.registration.sentry.cert_file`
- `tendermint.private_peer_id` removed
- added `tendermint.sentry.upstream_address` which should be set on sentry node
and it will set `tendermint.private_peer_id` and `tendermint.peristent_peer` for
the configured addresses
