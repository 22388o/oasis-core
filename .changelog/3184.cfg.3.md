go/runtime/scheduling: Rename "batching" algorithm to "simple"

The following `oasis-node registry runtime` command line flags have been
renamed:

- `runtime.txn_scheduler.batching.max_batch_size` to
`runtime.txn_scheduler.max_batch_size`.
- `runtime.txn_scheduler.batching.max_batch_size_bytes` to
`runtime.txn_scheduler.max_batch_size_bytes`.
