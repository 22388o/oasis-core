Send and check expected epoch number during transaction execution

Stress tests revealed some race conditions during transaction execution when
there is an epoch transition. Runtime client now sends `expectedEpochNumber`
parameter in `SubmitTx` call. The transaction scheduler checks whether the
expected epoch matches its local one. Additionally, if state transition occurs
during transaction execution, Executor and Merge committee correctly abort the
transaction.
