Add gRPC Sentry Nodes support.

This adds gRPC proxying and policy enforcement support to existing sentry nodes,
which enables protecting upstream nodes' gRPC endpoints.

Added/changed flags:

- `--worker.sentry.grpc.enabled` - enables the gRPC proxy (requires
`--worker.sentry.enabled` flag)
- `--worker.sentry.grpc.client.port` - port on which gRPC proxy is accessible.
- `--worker.sentry.grpc.client.address` - addresses on which gRPC proxy is
accessible (needed so protected nodes can query sentries for its addresses)
- `-worker.sentry.grpc.upstream.address` - address of the protected node
- `worker.sentry.grpc.upstream.cert` - public certificate of the upstream grpc
endpoint
- `worker.registration.sentry.address` renamed back to `worker.sentry.address`
- `worker.registration.sentry.cert_file` renamed back to `worker.sentry.cert_file`
