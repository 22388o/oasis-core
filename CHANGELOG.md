## 19.0 (2019-12-18)

### Process

- Start using the new Versioning and Release process for Oasis Core.
  ([#2419](https://github.com/oasislabs/oasis-core/issues/2419))

  Adopt a [CalVer](http://calver.org) (calendar versioning) scheme for Oasis
  Core (as a whole) with the following format:

  ```text
  YY.MINOR[.MICRO][-MODIFIER]
  ```

  where:
  - `YY` represents short year (e.g. 19, 20, 21, ...),
  - `MINOR` represents the minor version starting with zero (e.g. 0, 1, 2, 3,
    ...),
  - `MICRO` represents (optional) final number in the version (sometimes
    referred to as the "patch" segment) (e.g. 0, 1, 2, 3, ...).

    If the `MICRO` version is 0, it is be omitted.
  - `MODIFIER` represents (optional) build metadata, e.g. `git8c01382`.

  The new Versioning and Release process will be described in more detail in
  the future. For more details, see [#2457](
  https://github.com/oasislabs/oasis-core/issues/2457).
