// CryptoKitties is a pseudo-randomly generated transaction source intended to represent the
// cryptokitties contract.  A zipf distribution is used to model the cryptokitties contract
// parties: the dam kitten's owner (Alice), and the sire kitten's owner (Bob).  It is actually
// a 3-party transaction where Alice pays a siring fee to Bob and a birthing fee to the
// cryptokitties contract (K).  Later the cryptokitties contract pays the another party, the
// birther (Carol) who invokes the giveBirth method on the cryptokitties contract and drives
// the simulation forward.  Presumably the distribution for C is largely load-balanced across
// all auto-birthers.
//
// What this means is that there are two kinds of transactions: breeding, and birthing.  the
// breeding contract is a 3-party contract where one party is fixed, the cryptokitties account;
// the birthing contract is a 2-party contract between the auto-birther and cryptokitties.
//
// We use the address 0 as the cryptokitties address.  A, B, and C are randomly chosen so that
// the A â‰  B.  The number of breeding and birthing transactions should equal, but we just
// choose with probability 0.5 whether a transaction will be a breeding or birthing
// transaction.
//
// It is likely that the sire kitty distribution is over a smaller set, since to be a sire a
// kitty has to be listed to auction its siring.  We do not enforce anything here; the Rng can
// take this into account if needed.

// CryptoKittiesTransactionSource generates numTrans transactions.  About half will be 3 party
// transactions, and half will be 2 party transactions.  All will include the address 0 (K).
// The Rng for generating locations for A, B, and C may be an arbitrary distribution and should
// output in the range [1, num-addresses].
